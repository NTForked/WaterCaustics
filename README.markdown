Description
-----------

The aim of this project is to emulate the light patterns known as water caustics
typically seen on on the bottom of a swimming pool. 

Dependencies
------------

This code has been written in Python 2.7 with the following additional modules:

[Pyglet](http://www.pyglet.org/ "Pyglet") for OpenGL and windowing + controls

[Gletools](http://codeflow.org/entries/2009/jul/31/gletools-advanced-pyglet-utilities/ "Gletools") to allow compilation of GLSL shaders
